# Logic and Reasoning

I first approached this problem with the idea that the seven participants would just rotate paying for coffee each day under the assumption that everyone ordered the same type of coffee each day. This would make the total be the same every day and would result in the most "fair" practice.

After some thinking time I decided that maybe I would assume that a couple people ordered differently each day resulting in a different total price for each trip. I thought that I could then pick the person with the lowest running total paid as the next in line to pay for the groups coffee.

While the previous approach would work, I decided to add a little flavor to the group's coffee buyer by putting the rotation on a 5 day work week. At the end of the 5 days, the timer would reset for next week. The person paying for Monday (the first day of the timer) would no longer be in the running to pay for the rest of the week. So at the end of 5 days, 5 people out of the 7 would have paid for coffee. This gives each person a 1 out of 2 shot each week to not pay for coffee. 

I decided to make it scaleable in regards to adding more people to the coffee buying group. The current solution that I have implemented is rooted in the idea of having a fixed seven person sized group. In the event that I would scale this application. I would most likely implement a running total for each individual to ensure a more fair diviation of funds.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
